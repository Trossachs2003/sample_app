<!--The weird [if lt IE 9] syntax is not part of Rails; it’s actually a conditional comment supported by Internet Explorer browsers for just this sort of situation. It’s a good thing, too, because it means we can include the HTML5 shim only for IE browsers less than version 9, leaving other browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, and Safari unaffected.-->
